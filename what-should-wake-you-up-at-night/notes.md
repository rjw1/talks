# notes for what-should-wake-you-up-at-night

- A story about last weekend at my previous place of employment.
 - cruise ship photo
 - mention that at least one person here knwos this story already.
 - maybe use one of alexes photos
 - beign woken up 
 - always alerted at the same time
 - wasnt actaully an issue since it would clear in 30 minutes and was expected behaviour
 - so given this pain lets try and fix it.

- nothing
 - walk off stage

- ways to achieve not being woken up

- shift work
  - if we really have to
  - soemthing something shift work being bad for you.
- follow the sun oncall
  - good idea but is feasible
  - but as a lot of us know that isnt actually possible
  - you need to be a certain size
- self healing systems
   - pros + cons
   - clusters
   - failover
   - auto scaling
   - how and why to self heal
   - when it goes wrong its likely to go really wrong.
   - who knows what kubernetes is actaully doing :shrug:

- so before we get onto the what lets talk about the who.
 - ops team
 - dev team
 - devops team
  - obviously the last one is trick question if you have a devops team along with the other you are doing it wrong.
  - devops is a culture not a team or job title. 
    - yes this is a losing battle

 - everyone is the actual answer
 - thigns get fixed quickly if a dev gets woken up 
 - always 2! since being on call sucks.
  -  Always two there are - Yoda

- what?
 - pay attention if you ever apply to GDS ( we are hiring come speak to me)
 - its all about the users.
  - list things people want to monitor first. disk, cpu, memory. 
   - does the use care?
    - no. (what is the user need graphic)
  - ecommerce example
    - paying for stuff is the business and user need.
  - so monitor your imporant user jounrey
